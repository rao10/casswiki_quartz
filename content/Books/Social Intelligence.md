_Social Intelligence_, international edition.

_**Social Intelligence: The New Science of Human Relationships**_ is a book by Daniel Goleman, first published in 2006. It explains findings of social neuroscience in an easily understood way. Goleman uses simple explanations, analogies, and stories to illustrate how our brains are shaped for the social world and how we tick.

Among the subjects covered are different aspects of social awareness (including [[Empathy|empathy]]), abilities used in effective social interaction, and different ways in which we affect one another. Our social experiences trigger changes in our brains, hormones, and immune system. In turn, this affects not only ourselves, but also how we interact with others, and in turn also them.

The role of epigenetics in shaping who we are, which reconciles the nature vs. nurture debate, is also brought up: our experiences change which of our genes are expressed.
